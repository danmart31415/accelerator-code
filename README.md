# accelerator-code
Okay, I really dont know how it works but it works! What changed is I just abandoned the idea of splitting the masterfile into two, because its not really necessary, and it would just create unnnecesaary struggles for something that can be done with one file. I think later (when the project is complete and I can make upgrades) I will consider making this work.

What I did was I took the original list that was decoded and split and converted the elements to floats. This makes the plot look normal, because its not plotting strings.

that's all that has been changed for the major things, there are some minor things like adjusting the scale and having a photoList variable and photoString. Phtotostring is printed on the terminal and photolist is added to the file.

Now with this I can hookup the diodes and connect the diodes and mosfets. This will be the first test where its a proof of concept for the entire accelerator. The arduino program includes commands to turn on the mosfets and turn them off when the next coil is activated.
