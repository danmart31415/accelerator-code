# accelerator-code
To run all you need are:
	-Arduino_Python_v2_1_13_2021.zip
  -Magnets_12_31_2020.zip
  -Arduino_Code.zip

CHANGE YOUR PATHS IN THE FUNCTIONS FILE

Upload these to your desktop, but move the magnet folder to where you keep your arduino libraries (most likely documents if you have not changed it).

You should be able to run just the functions and script_v2 files on whatever IDE you use, but you can definitely run the Arduino_Python_v2_1_13_2021 on Atom.io.

The full Arduino_Python_v2_1_13_2021.zip has all of my trial attempts from when the progeamming started, the accelerator was not fully operational until January 4th (01-04-2021_09-42-27). This data will show you some developmental stages, but is not necessary. It does not include all of the previous versions of the code either. The closest substitute is looking at version one and version two.

Version one only makes plots and does not find zeroes or use functions. This version is harder to encorporate multiprocessing. Version 2 has the infrastructure, but is repeating the whole code for some reason and I was not able to figure it out. Maybe you can!

Arduino_Python_v2_Minimal_Data.zip has only the four official runs with small and big bearings with 5A and 12A. These are just what you need to get an idea of how it should run. These were all run with the current scripts that are already included in the downloads. You can run it as is, but maybe change the serial port depending on your arduino plug in and baudrate. Without deviating from the initial download you only need to run the code and it will produce similar results as the included folders.
