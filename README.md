# accelerator-code
all the code needed for the accelerator, as well as instructions on what to do.


This branch includes the new CSV files created by running the master arduino program. Nothing has changed from the master other than the new csv files. Reference these when looking at how I want to make the csv files look.

that being said, it did not create a second csv file probably because of the Serial.Print("coil #"); commands so i can see when it is turned off.
